# MLT: Introduction to Neural Networks

The notebooks in this repo are intended to introduce those with an interest in Neural Networks how to build their own, without heavy deep learning libraries, so that the methodology is better understood. I am by no means an expert in the subject but I'm definitely fascinated by it, so this feels like a good way to share my interest while also reinforcing the tiny amount that I've learned so far. Without doubt, this topic is one that requires multiple sittings and frequent revision of the material.

I am hoping that the notebooks here provide a helpful accompaniment to the short paper I wrote as part of research and development within the Machine Learning Team: _A Simple Introduction To Neural Networks_. A pdf of this paper is available here and also on the Quantum confluence page.
