##Introduction to Neural Networks: Data Helpers

A small package of helper functions and data set generators to help with the _Introduction to Neural Networks_ notebook series.
Example use:

    from nnhelper import spiral

Will also be adding functionality to export the code from each lesson as a py module to a user provided location.
